# LOTR_Akinator

Project for a text-based game. The Akinator game is played between the machine and a person.
For now there is only english files, so when the player is asked to choose language, he has to write "en".

Rules:
1. The player has to think of a character (the example files are for LOTR characters, can be added different)
2. The player has to give an honest answer to the questions, which are printed on the screen.
3. After certain amount of questions the machine will or will not guess the character.

If not guessed:
The player has to name the character he was thinking of.
If the character exists in the .txt file, the player is asked to go through the answers he has given. If the computer has made a mistake, the answer can be corrected.
If this is a new character, the player has to add a question, which will distinguish him from the others.
